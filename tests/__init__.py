"""This package contains the fairreckitlib test suite.

Modules:

    conftest: constants and fixtures that are shared among all files in the test suite.
    test_core_config_factories: test the functionality of all (base) types of config factories.
    test_core_config_params: test the configuration parameters functionality.
    test_core_config_yml_obj: test the yml and object configuration functionality.
    test_core_events: test the core event dispatching/listening functionality.
    test_core_io: test the core IO functionality.
    test_core_parsing_assert: test the assertion parsing functionality.
    test_core_parsing_obj_params: test the object (parameters) parsing functionality.
    test_core_pipeline: test the core pipeline functionality.
    test_core_threading: test the threading base/processor functionality.
    test_data_converting: test the dataframe rating conversion functionality.
    test_data_factory: test the data (modifier) factories.
    test_data_splitting: test the dataframe splitting functionality.
    test_evaluation_config: test the formatting/parsing of the eval config of the experiment.
    test_evaluation_factory: test the evaluation (type/category) factories.
    test_model_algorithm_matrices: test the interface of the algorithm matrices.
    test_model_algorithms: test the interface of predictors/recommenders.
    test_model_config: test the formatting/parsing of the model config of the experiment.
    test_model_factory: test the model (type/API) factories.
    test_model_pipeline: test the model pipeline functionality.
